# KattisProblems
Repository for random kattis problem solutions. File names correspond to the problem name on open.kattis.com/problems/*

Solution languages are between Java and Python right now, but that is just what I have been working on previously. Most of these are really quick problems.
The solutions can be found in the src/ folder; each problem has its own folder and most of them have only one file in it, but this is because of the ignored .class bytecode files.

To run:
- Python solutions: `py -3 file.py` for Windows, `{whatever you named your python 3 installation} -3 file.py` everywhere else or if the first one doesn't work. The solutions were written in Python 3
- Java solutions: `javac File.java` then `java File`. All solutions are written using JDK 11 but should be compatible much farther back: not many advanced language features were used.
